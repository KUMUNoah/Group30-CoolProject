SkinAI is a deep learning system for multi-class classification of dermatological skin lesions using the PAD-UFES-20 dataset. Our goal is to improve diagnostic performance on imbalanced and clinically critical classes (such as melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma) by combining convolutional neural networks with patient metadata.
